_**Travelling salesman problem**_

_**TSP**_ is a classic optimization problem where
the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly 
once and returns to the starting point. This project explores several methods to 
solve TSP, including both brute-force and heuristic approaches.

In first part of this project I was resolving TSP problem with those methods:
* Brute - Force
* Nearest - Neighbour
* Random
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Serach
* Lowest Cost

The pdf named _**Raport_1.pdf**_ have time results of each method shown with the usage
of the graphs. Also there are comparison of those methods.
