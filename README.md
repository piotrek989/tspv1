_**Travelling salesman problem 1**_

_**TSP**_ is a classic optimization problem where
the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly 
once and returns to the starting point.

In this repo you can see resolving TSP with those methods:
* Repetetive Nearest Neighbour
* Random appraoch
* Tabu - Search
* Simulated Annealing

The pdf named _**Raport_2.pdf**_ have time results and correctness result
of each method shown with the usage
of the graphs. There are algorithms from first and second part of project.
Also you can find comparison of all those methods.
