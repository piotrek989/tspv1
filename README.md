_**Travelling salesman problem v1**_

In first part of this project I was resolving TSP problem with those methods:
* Brute - Force
* Nearest - Neighbour
* Random
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Serach
* Lowest Cost

The pdf named _**Raport_1.pdf**_ have time results of each method shown with the usage
of the graphs. Also there are comparison of those methods.
